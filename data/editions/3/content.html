    <h2>
		Instapaper, Readability and monetizing other peoples content  		Tech News and Analysis	</h2><div><div>
 
<p>Updated: Theres been a minor furore brewing in the digital-content sphere over the past few days involving Readability, an app and web service that allows readers to save content from any website and read it later  without any of the advertising that most sites rely on for revenue. Not surprisingly, this idea doesnt appeal to a lot of publishers, and John Gruber of Daring Fireball re-ignited the current firestorm of criticism with some comments about how the team behind Readability are scumbags. Whatever you think of Readabilitys model, however, it is far from the only one providing this kind of service, and there is an argument to be made that its approach is actually better than some others. The bottom line for content creators is that users want to do this, and you need to figure out how to let them.</p>
<p>The latest wave of negative attention for Readability was triggered by AppAdvice, which noticed that when users shared an article that they had saved for later by posting it to Twitter or Facebook from the mobile app, the link included by Readability was to the saved version  the one stripped of all the ads and images and other content  instead of to the original at the publishers site. After AppAdvice flagged this issue and before Gruber made his scumbags comment, Readability then responded by changing the way it handles links in the mobile app, and admitted that its initial approach wasnt fair to content creators (the web browser version includes a Readability bar that shows the original article in a frame, and allows users to click and see the stripped-down version).</p>
 Is collecting money for publishers a favor, or extortion? 
<p>Even after this change, however, the comments made by Gruber seemed to reverberate through the blogosphere, in part because they focused on another controversial aspect of Readabilitys model: unlike other services such as Instapaper, which simply charges a standard fee for its service, Readability allows readers to donate money that is held for the creators of the content. Publishers can sign up and collect their share of this revenue (70 percent goes to publishers and Readability keeps 30 percent), but if they dont sign up or register, then Readability just keeps the money. This model has drawn a lot of criticism from those who argue that it is effectively extortion:</p>
 
@anildash When somebody collects money in your name w/out your consent (with a cut), it's called something else in many boroughs of NYC. Kontra (@counternotions) November 18, 2011
 
<p>Readability has its defenders, including Anil Dash  who is an advisor to the company, and argued in a blog post that the startup is trying to do what plenty of other services are trying to do: namely, to figure out a way for publishers and content creators to monetize their content in other ways apart from just lathering as many ads and other gimmicks onto their pages as possible. The fact that many users decide to strip out those ads and read articles through Readability or Instapaper, he says, shows that many publishers are actually shooting themselves in the foot by making their websites unreadable in an attempt to generate revenue (Readabilitys own defence of its model is here).</p>
<p>The issue over Readabilitys model is complicated somewhat by the tangled relationship between it and Instapaper, which was founded by former Tumblr developer Marco Arment. In 2010, the two companies formed a partnership in which Arment created a white-label version of Instapaper that Readability could use inside their iPhone app  but just as it was about to be released, Apple introduced its in-app subscription rules, which would have forced Readability to hand over 30 percent of any revenue they collected. The app was shelved, and Readability then went on to develop its own Instapaper-style app without Arments help, which caused some tension between the two  and between supporters of the two companies such as Dash and Gruber.</p>
 Readers want to do this  publishers need to figure out how 
<p>As Mike Davidson of Newsvine notes in a post on the issue, the bottom line is that services like Instapaper and Readability  and other similar apps such as Read It Later, or even Apples Safari browser, which has a Reader feature that strips out everything but text  are likely perfectly legal under current copyright laws, because users are saving copies of the content for their personal use (the news-aggregation app Zite got a cease-and-desist letter from some major content companies for a similar feature). Not only that, but Davidson makes a pretty persuasive argument that there is nothing wrong with Readabilitys revenue model of keeping money for publishers.</p>
 The anger about the financial side of Readability seems to come from the opinion that the company is keeping publishers money unless they sign up, but I guess I look at it differently: I dont think it is the publishers money. I think it is Readabilitys money. Readability invests the time and resources into developing their service and they are the ones who physically get users to pay a subscription fee. 
<p>I think Davidson makes a good point  although its not one that most publishers are likely going to be that sympathetic to. But why is Readabilitys model any worse than Instapapers or any other similar ad-stripping service? Marco Arment charges money for his apps and service, which take a publishers content and remove all of that advertising just the same way Readability does, and he keeps that revenue. Readabilitys approach may feel like extortion to publishers who dont like the idea of people altering their content or consuming it in other ways  but the reality is that this is happening all the time, whether the media industry likes it or not. It might be the Huffington Post aggregating your stories, or it might be Flipboard or Zite giving people a different way of seeing it, or it might be Instapaper.</p>
<p>At least Readability is trying to help publishers monetize that content in some way, by giving them a revenue share when they register with the service, as Clay Johnson points out. Is that an incentive to sign up? Sure it is. But at a time when content companies are trying everything they can to figure out how to monetize what they produce  whether its paywalls or apps or other subscription models  why not take advantage of a service that at least some readers have already shown they want, and are willing to pay for? Either that, or come up with your own version of Readability and compete.</p>
<p>Update: John Gruber has clarified his position in a new post, saying he doesnt like the fact that Readability says 70 percent of a users monthly contribution goes to the content creators, since not all of that money is paid out  because the company only pays publishers who have registered. Gruber says the service should either make it clear not all of the money is paid to content owners, or it should split whatever it has among those who have registered. The way the company is doing it now is misleading at best, and arguably dishonest, he says.</p>

    <h2>The newsonomics of 100 products a year » Nieman Journalism Lab</h2><div><div>
<p>Try this: Call up your local newspaper or online news organization. Tell them you want to buy something and ask them what they can sell you? Of course, at first, theyd be non-plussed: Sell you something? Then, after giving it some thought, theyd say you can buy a newspaper or a subscription or a membership  or, maybe, an ad? Would you like one of those?</p>
<p>Those days  mark it  are coming to an end. Were on the brink of news companies producing hundreds of products for sale each year. While digital technology hath taketh (the easy ability to make money on news distribution), digital technology also giveth back, with the ability to create hundreds and thousands of newsy products at small incremental costs. The bonus: News organizations will be able to satisfy groups of readers and advertisers (often disguised thinly as sponsors) better than ever before. Double bonus: The let-a-hundred-products-bloom revolution fits neatly with the all-out embrace of all-access circulation initiatives, which news companies in North America, Europe, and Asia now cant seem to implement quickly enough.</p>
<p>Can we call this the ebook revolution? Maybe, but thats probably too narrow. Delivery of new products to new audiences can take several forms. A text-only ebook, a shinier iBooks-enabled product with video, or an app with all the glorious functionality apps offer. Its not the form; its the content, content that satisfies niches rather than serves masses with one-size-fits-all newspaper or magazine products.</p>
<p>Call it the newsonomics of 100 products a year, or just one way to envision a much bigger future.</p>
<p>The 100-product-a-year model is a much-needed growth model. We can see how it fits nicely with all-access subscriptions, and together we have two interconnected Lego blocks of a new sustainable news model. We have two essential parts of a crossover model (The newsonomics of crossover) that I detailed here a few weeks ago. The big, hairy challenges of accelerating print ad loss and onerous legacy costs remain, but at least weve got a couple of building blocks we didnt have two years ago. By we, I mean those of us who care about news and great professional content.</p>
<p>Is it a big moneymaker? We dont know yet, though we can extrapolate some numbers below.</p>
<p>Its directionally right, though, for at least a couple of strategic reasons. The notion of 100 smaller products reminds us that so much of the new world is based on volume. Google has built a monstrous advertising business on hundreds of thousands of smaller advertisers, while daily newspapers reaped huge profits on relatively few bigger advertisers. Even as movie watching by streaming surpasses DVD watching, more money is still in the old medium. Streaming will monetize at a lower rate, but end up generating bigger dollars over time. The same thing is true in the digital music business. Selling lots of stuff to lots of people at smaller price points is something the Internet enables superbly.</p>
<p>Yes, there are definitely new winners and losers in movies and music, as there will be in news. Those who transition best and fastest will win.</p>
<p>Second, its in line with the strategic push to satisfy the hell out of core customers. As publishers have figured out that its the top 15 percent of site visitors who make the big difference in building the new digital business  perhaps paying for subscriptions, consuming many more pages than fly-by users sent by Google  core customer satisfaction is key. Ebooks deeper the relationship to that reader customer.</p>
<p>This 100-product-a-year model may fit as well with the new California Watch/Bay Citizen combo (The newsonomics of the death and life of California news), finalized Tuesday, as its does with The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, the Charlotte Observer, GQ, or Conde Nast Traveler.</p>
<p>Lets take one example. On Wednesday, the Boston Globe launched Sunday Supper &amp; More. Its a cookbook. Its New England. And it could be the beginning of a new franchise: Expect summer, fall and winter editions each year to join this spring debut. The Globes staff built it with Apples iBooks Author tool, so it offers video within it.</p>
<p>Want to buy it? Not so fast. Today, Sunday Supper &amp; More is only available to Boston Globe print, all-access, and digital subscribers. So subscription  think membership (the recent riff of the L.A. Times new paywall intro)  is gaining new benefits. Surprise, says the Globe, you not only get our paper, our spiffy new replica-plus edition, if thats what you want, and our mobile apps  you also get our cool cookbooks, with more to come.</p>
<p>The Globe will sell the book to non-subscribers  probably at $4.99  but will decide the timing of that sale after next weeks Globe confab at which execs and editors will plot an ebook plan for the company.</p>
<p>Events and ebooks will be the two biggest perks of the new Globe subscription push, says Jeff Moriarty, the Globes VP of digital products. Beyond Sunday Suppers and a new spin on the Fenway 100 historical Red Sox book, we can picture the Globe soon mining its archives in both sports and features to provide new value for customers and a new leg of revenue. It experimented early with three books on its Whitey Bulger stories, and learned some lessons in pricing, distribution, and the technical creation process along the way.</p>
<p>The Globe has plenty of company in this push. We see Canadas National Post committing to a couple of dozen ebooks in the coming year, again from hard news to features (To learn what works (quickly), Canadas National Post dives into ebooks). Guardian Shorts is an early innovator; Politico is churning out four campaign ebooks this year.</p>
<p>Magazine publishers, faster than newspaper publishers to embrace the tablet as the next-gen platform, are also ahead of most newspaper publishers in ebooks. Vanity Fairs done more than a half dozen, and its parent Conde Nast is hosting an explosion of more single-purpose apps in the iTunes Store, some unrelated to Condes magazines. Hearsts Cosmopolitan is embracing ebooks, and now partnering, along with ProPublica  an early tester of ebooks  with Open Road Integrated Media. Open Road Integrated Media?</p>
<p>Well, its a book company, an ebook company juiced on the possibilities of our age. Headed by former HarperCollins CEO Jane Friedman, the company is prototypical of a new group of middlemen. With book marketing savvy (cover design, marketing, distribution+), these companies are now feeding the emerging ebook marketplace. They are also partnering back for that old standby, print, as Open Road has done with book services company Ingram. In Canada, it was Harper Collins Canada that became the National Posts partner in bringing news ebooks to market.</p>
<p>Just as the web has knocked many middlemen for a loop, it creates openings for new ones.</p>
<p>If you talk to publishers about ebooks, they are farther along in experimenting than they were a year ago. Yet some basic issues  producing the books, marrying them to commerce engines, placing them prominently in e-stores and more  are giving them headaches as they push forward. How do we make the right offer to the right person at the right time? one experienced exec asked.</p>
<p>The marketplace has been exploding (recall that Amazon announced last spring that its ebooks were now outselling its paper books), but those issues are setting the stage for a new group of companies, many staffed with graduates of the book industry, offering their help. Newspaper and magazine publishers are looking to the Open Roads for guidance.</p>
<p>Some are turning to their digital circulation partner, Press+. That company, which is powering more than 280 titles subscription commerce, says its system can handle the commerce and even help with identifying likely customers, based on tracked content usage, so its customers are just beginning to ply the ebook trade.</p>
<p>ProPublica general manager Dick Tofel opted for Open Road for the non-profit investigative publishers fifth and sixth books. He says the company will start producing a half dozen or more a year now and is now fielding calls from other publishers eager to get the benefit of his early ebook experience.</p>
<p>So far, ProPublica has put 90,000 ebooks into the market. The first couple were free downloads, but with the addition of new original introductions to work ProPublica had already published free online, Amazon and ProPublica agreed on test pricing of 99 cents and $1.99, and new revenue is rolling in. Its small, but pound for pound, it generates more than advertising, notes Tofel, who is a Wall Street Journal veteran. And, of course, the incremental cost of creating ebooks is closer to zero, with most sales cost able to be a commissioned cost of sale.</p>
<p>As assistant publisher, Tofel oversaw the print books business thats been a good Dow Jones sideline for a long time.</p>
<p>Those books  personal investing and more  are naturals for the ebook revolution now. Look for the Journal to experiment more with those titles, perhaps niching by life stage.</p>
<p>As news and magazine publishers look to this new revenue stream, here are six points to ponder:</p>
<p>Its about product development: Yes, its editing, but fundamentally, its a mindset change for many publishers stuck in the one-size-fits-all world. Publishers either need staffers with new product chops or partners wanting to license publisher content and create the products for the marketplace.</p>
<p>Free the archives!: Digital archives have never been a big business for publishers, caught somewhere between Google and musty library connotations. Packaged archives  for specific audiences  can offer new life for older content.</p>
<p>Dont think content; think problem solving: Publishers too often start with content. If we start with audience  college-planning students and parents, new mothers and fathers to be, bored cooks, and, big time, sports enthusiasts of all ages  we can see the motors of ebook publishing beginning to role. Think life stage, just for starters, and add the geo angle, and regional publishers can play.</p>
<p>Mining the database: As onesies and twosies, its fairly easy to pick content from publishers own databases. Think of bigger production cycle, going beyond the 100 a year, to a thousand, all niched products that could be semi-automated and templated over time. Better tagging of content for ebook usage then becomes a priority.</p>
<p>Ebook or app?: Early experimenters say let the content be your guide. The more multimedia, the better an app may work. Ebooks, though, can be sold through more distributors, while Apple continues to dominate the app business.</p>
<p>Pricing: Whats an ebook worth? If it solidifies a subscriber/member paying $300 or more a year, its worth a lot, even if its free. Think of the lifetime value of that subscriber.</p>
<p>To the right niche, some ebooks will be worth $1.99 and others  Retina perfect  will go for $19.99. Lets take our 100 products a year. Lets average 5,000 sales for each. Lets price at $2.99 on average. That would be $1.5 million. Some books, though, could be blockbusters. We can play with this math and see where it goes.</p>
<p>For the ProPublicas, its a nice non-ad revenue stream. For other publishers, its at least a growing third leg of revenue (beyond ads and circulation) and one that may be nurtured into something significant. (Last fall, Will Sullivan offered a gaggle of reasons ebooks make sense for publishers.) As importantly, it can reinforce those two legs, pleasing subscribers/members with free (or discounted) perks and advertisers/sponsors who have new opportunities to represent themselves to niche audiences. Thats a pretty good combination, and one that publishers will soon embrace, just as they lately have all-access digital circulation.</p>

<p>To the right niche, some ebooks will be worth $1.99 and others  Retina perfect  will go for $19.99. Lets take our 100 products a year. Lets average 5,000 sales for each. Lets price at $2.99 on average. That would be $1.5 million. Some books, though, could be blockbusters. We can play with this math and see where it goes.</p>
<p>For the ProPublicas, its a nice non-ad revenue stream. For other publishers, its at least a growing third leg of revenue (beyond ads and circulation) and one that may be nurtured into something significant. (Last fall, Will Sullivan offered a gaggle of reasons ebooks make sense for publishers.) As importantly, it can reinforce those two legs, pleasing subscribers/members with free (or discounted) perks and advertisers/sponsors who have new opportunities to represent themselves to niche audiences. Thats a pretty good combination, and one that publishers will soon embrace, just as they lately have all-access digital circulation.</p>

    <h2>Destination Local - Nesta </h2><div><div>
 Destination Local 
<p>Local media plays two important roles in people's lives. It is both functional, telling us what is going on, where and when, and also emotional, helping us to feel that we belong to our local community.</p>
<p>People feel attached not just to their city, town or village, but also to their neighbourhood and street. New, location-based technology offers a potential revolution for very local - "hyperlocal" - media services delivering content at a local level.</p>
<p>NESTA wants to understand the potential economic and social opportunities for hyperlocal media in the UK. It has launched a new programme - Destination Local - to understand and stimulate the development of this emerging sector.</p>
<p>As part of the programme, we intend to fund 10 proposals that develop and test prototype services for the next generation of hyperlocal media.</p>
<p>In particular, we are looking for prototypes that make the most of mobile technologies to deliver geographically-relevant local media.</p>
<p>Our goal in funding the prototypes is to understand what new business models may be required, what types of service work well with audiences and the challenges and opportunities of using mobile technologies.  Successful applications will be able to demonstrate how they help to understand these themes. </p>
<p>A selection panel (to be announced) will review applications and agree on the final prototype services.  Learning from each funded prototype will be made public for the benefit of the sector.</p>
<p>NESTA is offering 10 organisations up to £50,000 to develop next generation hyperlocal media services.</p>
<p>Applications can be either new ideas seeking seed funding to launch or existing models seeking to grow and develop.</p>
<p>Eligibility Criteria</p>
<p>Applications must be:</p>
 For services located in the UK
Using mobile technology to deliver a geographically-relevant service
Engaging and interact with local community
Able to provide evidence of audience demand/local need
Able to provide evidence of a potential sustainable revenue model
 <p> </p>
<p>Selection Criteria</p>
<p>Applications will be scored against the following criteria:</p>
 The service makes use of mobile technology to deliver a geographically relevant local service 
The service engages with the community for public benefit  
The applicant provides evidence of audience demand / local need for the service
The service provides evidence of a potential revenue model following initial grant funding
The service demonstrates quality and accuracy of content 
The service offers links with other local services 
The service tests an innovative business model 
The service brings local people or communities together offline
The service offers a scalable solution 
The team has the ability to deliver the service 
 <p>Applicants will also need to submit a video presentation which will be openly available on Youtube.</p>
<p>The Technology Strategy Board is running a parallel Destination Local competition to encouraging innovative, hyperlocal cross-media platforms and enabling technologies that will drive new service offerings, reach out into communities and provide conduits for public services. Details can be found here.  </p>
<p>Successful NESTA funded applicants will have the opportunity to meet with and potentially collaborate with Technology Strategy Board funded projects as part of the Destination Local programme.</p>
<p>For more information about hyperlocal media, read our recent landscape review. It maps the current landscape of hyperlocal media activity in the UK, defining what we mean by the term, highlighting the ingredients for success and identifying some of the challenges the sector is facing.</p>

	<h1><a href="http://twitter.com/NiemanLab" >@NiemanLab</a>: "Practice, pray, and have redundancies": How tech sites and liveblog tools prep for an Apple keynote <a href="http://t.co/F3jvJ4Yi" >t.co/F3jvJ4Yi</a> </h1>

    <h2>Practice, pray, and have redundancies: On the imperfect science of liveblogging » Nieman Journalism Lab</h2><div><div>
<p>When, a few months from now, someone asks the question  Where were you when the iPad HD was announced?  how many of us would answer: Staring at my computer, manically switching between tabs, hitting refresh?</p>
<p>Sure, for most people, an Apple announcement isnt worth a moments attention, much less 90 minutes worth. But for a lot of us, a new shiny gadget finds us glued not to a TV, but a liveblog. Born out of the need to cover events that dont allow streaming video but beg to be broadcast, tech sites liveblogging an event put a premium on text, speed, and stills. And it works  its almost hard to find a significant event in the space that doesnt get liveblogged these days.</p>
<p>And as liveblogging has ascended, news sites and individual journalists have developed their craft, combining technical prowess, advance planning, the spirit of improv, and yes, some tried and true reporting techniques.</p>
<p>Liveblogging itself is a content tool, Gizmodo editor-in-chief Joe Brown told me. And its a lot of fun. Its not just fun for readers but fun for writers cause its just old school blogging. Its uptempo, high energy, intensely focused and somehow extremely loose all at the same time. When a Gizmodo liveblog rolls out its a neatly packaged machine, text flowing inline with photos with stories posted throughout the duration of an event. Gizmodo, like many tech blogs, has this down to a routine  or, actually, a drill. We had a practice run on Monday, Brown told me. Yes, we do practice. </p>
<p>In this case, using video from a previous iPad launch, the team, including a handful of reporters, editors, and tech staff, went through the motions of covering the event. One reason for that is to make sure there are no kinks in their system (Gizmodo uses a custom liveblogging tool built by Gawker Medias developers.)</p>
 The mechanics 
<p>For an event like the (assumed) third-gen iPad launch today, Gizmodo will try to get as many of their people in the event as possible. (Gizmodo and Apple havent always had the best relationship.) In a typical liveblog scenario theyll have staff writers who act as hosts, in this case reporter Mat Honan and managing editor Brian Barrett, as well as other reporters to follow up stories or threads coming out of the announcement and generate posts for the main Gizmodo stream. For photos, their cameras are tethered to laptops running a program that uploads, resizes, and watermarks images within seconds of being shot. </p>
 They are looking for this stream of information that they have become accustomed to. 
<p>Thanks to the many rumors about what to expect, many of the actual lead stories thatll come out of the event are around 95 percent pre-written, Brown said. Thats how you see these extremely detailed, extremely well edited and ready posts popping up five minutes after the announcement has happened, Brown said. </p>
<p>But technical prowess and preparation can only go so far, and what can make the difference in liveblogging is the pace, knowledge, and voice of the people behind it. Brown said Honan and Barrett are both knowledgable reporters, but together they make a tandem that balances humor, skepticism, and quick analysis. Brown said personality, coupled with solid behind-the-scenes production, is what continues to draw in readers. People want to watch it like the local news, Brown said. They are looking for this stream of information that they have become accustomed to.</p>
<p>As liveblogs has become more ubiquitous, their writing styles have grown more varied. Some favor a just-the-facts-maam near-transcript; others mix in more commentary and reaction or humor. Over email, Reuters social media editor Anthony De Rosa said the tone should be dictated by the occasion. For televised events, no one wants a play-by-play of what they can see. Thats different for events like product launches: Things like the Apple event they absolutely want constant updates with as much transcription as possible because of a lack of live stream, he said. </p>
 The background tech 
<p>For companies that dont have a team of engineers in Eastern Europe working on blogging software, its common to use off-the-shelf tools, the largest being ScribbleLive and CoveritLive, which is owned by Demand Media. The markets largely split between the two, with People, Sports Illustrated, Entertainment Weekly, and Le Monde on Team CoveritLive, and Reuters, the AP, The Verge, ESPN, CNET, The Globe and Mail, and others using ScribbleLive. With so many organizations relying on just two companies for their liveblogging needs, the responsibility falls on ScribbleLive and CoveritLive to make sure theres no coverage-killing technical problems  something thats proven a problem during previous Apple keynotes, which for liveblogging tools are the Super Bowl and Oscar night wrapped up into one.</p>
 If there wasnt any risk of screwing up, it wouldnt be so much fun. 
<p>Jonathan Keebler, CTO and founder of ScribbleLive, told me over email that Apple events typically generate large amounts of traffic and he expects to set new records today. As liveblogging has been put to use in more events, that means the product has to be ready at any time for unexpected amounts of users, whether its earthquakes in Japan or Super Tuesday. Steve Semelsberger, senior vice president and general manager for social solutions at Demand Media, told me they prepare for increased volume by redirecting staff to work on the engineering and operations of their platform on expected big traffic days. In some cases they coordinate with media companies directly in anticipation of big events. Semelsberger told me more than 300 media outlets used CoveritLive during the Academy Awards, with a peak audience just over 400,000 active users.</p>
<p>Despite the ease-of-use tools can bring, it makes sense for media companies to have a backup plan in mind should the thought of a double-resolution iPad screen excite tech enthusiasts to a server-melting degree. That might mean switching to regular blogging or Twitter (another platform thats had troubles with Apple keynote traffic). Brown has a mantra that most editors would recognize: Practice, pray, and have redundancies. Still, the uncertainty that comes with covering any event live, knowing a multitude of things could go awry either on the technical or human end, may be part of what gives liveblogging its particular energy. Said Brown: If there wasnt any risk of screwing up, it wouldnt be so much fun.</p>

    <h2> - How We Will Read: an interview with @stevenbjohnson from the @findings blog </h2><div><div>
<p>Reading. Its a simple act. Youre doing it right now. You probably read something off of billboards, screens, and packages hundreds of times throughout the course of a single day. Can something so fundamental really be changing?</p>
<p>Here at Findings, we believe it is. We engage in conversations with our users every day about what they need to fill in the gap between their reading experience and what they imagine it could be. Reading in a digital age gives us both more tools and more distractions to contend with.</p>
<p>We wanted to start asking authors, publishers, and thinkers we knew: How do you read now? And how is it going to change? In that vein we want to welcome you to How We Will Read, a series of conversations about social reading, digital media, and annotation with literary minds like Clay Shirky, Maud Newton, Laura Miller, and Richard Nash. Were excited to get inside the reading process of some of our favorite writers  and to share their thoughts with you.</p>
<p>Were very happy to kick off How We Will Read with author Steven Johnson, whos been an adviser to Findings since day one. His most recent book, Where Good Ideas Come From: The Natural History of Innovation, explores what kinds of environments foster intellectual breakthroughs. Looking through Stevens Findings page or Twitter account is a romp through genres and inspirations  youll find tech news, political analysis, and cultural critique, from Dickens to the Federalist Papers. Broad-base innovation is at the core of Stevens thinking. So we asked him: Where does reading need to innovate?</p>
<p>How do you do most of your reading these days?</p>
<p>Wherever possible, I read books using the Kindle app on the iPad. But I do a lot of reading of articles, essays, blog posts, and Wikipedia in the browser. (Usually Firefox on the Mac, though sometimes Safari on the iPad.) I know it is supposed to be on the decline, but I do more loosely-directed surfing than ever: I head off in one general direction, and start following the links, which usually end up taking me somewhere completely unplanned. (I wrote a little case study of how this works here.) But its not the classical web surfing, where you just click on one link after another; its more staggered that that, and it often involves social media. So someone will link to an interesting article on Twitter, and Ill go read it, and itll mention some musician Ive never heard of, so Ill Google his name, and read the Wikipedia entry, which will send me to a Pitchfork article, which will send me off to a new Google query about some sub-genre of music Ive never heard of, which will lead me to a book I download for Kindle. Repeat, ad nauseum.</p>
<p>If you could move one feature of paper books to digital books, what would that be?</p>
<p>Skimming. Its a funny thing with print vs. ebooks; the digital age is supposed to be all about attention deficit disorder and hypertextual distractions, but ebooks lock you into reading them in a linear fashion more than print books do. Its much easier to pick up a print book and flip through the pages, get a sense of the argument or structure, than it is with an ebook (or magazine.) Its a very interesting interface challenge: I think its probably solvable, and I know many smart folks are working on it, but we dont have a true solution yet.</p>
<p>Can you recall the moment you fell in love with reading?</p>
<p>I have been a reader for as long as I can remember. I would just lock into books and sit there on the couch with them for hours. When I was in second grade, I remember being obsessed with the Great Brain series, which we just tracked down on Amazon and read with our older boys this fall. They loved them as well, which was 1) pretty surprising, since theyre all about life in a small town in Utah in the 1890s, and 2) incredibly gratifying to see as a parent.</p>
<p>Has reading become more social for you?</p>
<p>My article/essay/blog post reading has become intensely social. I think easily more than half of the articles I read in the average day come from passed links on Twitter. Those social recommendations are a tremendous source of serendipity, much more interesting and unpredictable than they are given credit for. Its not just an echo chamber of predictable fare from a close circle of friends, partially because I follow a lot of people from different fields who are not personal friends: musicians and political writers and food writers and movie critics, etc. And also because theyre often retweeting interesting links from people Ive never even heard of. This is not a new idea: its the strength of weak ties argument essentially. But Im surprised that people still underestimate the power of those weak ties in terms of making surprising and rich new connections.</p>
<p>Do you often annotate what youre reading? Why? How has this changed over time, with the advent of new technology? </p>
<p>I used to read print books with a pen  assuming it was work-related, and not a beach read  and would highlight passages and scribble short comments in the margins. And then I would go through these elaborate steps to convert the text into digital form so I could store and search it later, with comments. Now Findings has taken almost all the labor out of the capturing process, but interestingly I have stopped making comments in the margins, even though technically you can do with the Kindle and with Findings. I just select and store the text, and assume Ill figure out why I selected it later on. Im not exactly sure why that happened with the shift to screen reading. I may need to restore my annotation habit.</p>
<p>How do you see reading evolving in the years to come?</p>
<p>Probably the biggest change is going to come from the changed definition of what were reading. More and more, texts will evolve the way Wikipedia entries evolve; the idea of a finished text, where all the words have been locked down, will start to seem a little less orthodoxsomething youd expect from a novel, but not from a magazine article, say. And that open-endedness will likely mean that the reader is capable of participating, adding links, commenting, suggesting new avenues for exploration, fact-checking. So well have to read in an even more focused way, I suspect, knowing that we can have a say in where the text eventually goes. So there you go: ebooks and digital text are keeping us from skimming *and* forcing us to engage with the text more directly. Who would have thought it?</p>
<p>Find Steven on Twitter, Findings, and at his personal blog.</p>
